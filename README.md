# LiaIndex projects!

Hi everyone, i'm Lia and this is my github page for my personal projects, here i will upload all the stuff i find interesting somehow, if you want to see a preview of the most interesting ones please visit our instagram account 	[code_mathemagicians](https://www.instagram.com/code_mathemagicians), actually we are a small team and we can upload new content when we have free time which is no much because the university x)

# Simple mp3 

Not everything has to have a very complicated math related stuff to actually be interesting, this is one of my favourites projects, everything you see is coded by me, the style, the time bar, the particles... It uses p5.js for drawing the canvas and the sound extension to have the fft and get the sound spectrum :)

# Lissajous figures

I love this project, when i was super young math was that wall i cannot pass in anyway, i just didn't get it, sines and cosines were an abstract and complicated stuff that i couldn't understand, was with this project when i finally understand it (and it was not soo difficult)

# The noise

One thing that i love about the journey i'm in learning, is how some algorithms can be so aesthetic and so beautifull, this kind of particle simulations with noise are just mesmerizing.
